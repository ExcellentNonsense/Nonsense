## Concept
The [concept](https://github.com/ExcellentNonsense/NonsenseConcept) of the project.

## Flickr API key
The application contains the Flickr API key in the appsettings.json file. A temporary key can be obtained from [this](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.getInfo) page. Click the "Call Method ..." button and extract the key from the link that appears below. If the images are not loaded on the "Band->Flickr" page, you probably need to update the key.
